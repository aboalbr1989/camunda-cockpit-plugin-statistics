## Get started

To include this plugin into your cockpit you can either include it in your custom build on [camunda's plugin store](http://camunda.org/plugins/) or you build the cockpit on your own and deploy it to your server.
Do not forget to customize build.properties in case you choose the latter option. Please customize testdbs.properties.example, too to get the tests running on your system. For that you may remove // comment out test classes and/or dependencies you dont need/have (e.g. DB2 driver).
